        My design approach is characterized by pushing the boundaries of traditional graphic design, experimenting fearlessly with unconventional color palettes and combinations. I believe that colors are a powerful tool to evoke emotions, convey messages, and create unique visual experiences. As I continue my journey in graphic design, I am excited to keep pushing the envelope and creating designs that captivate and inspire audiences.

        My interest in web design can be traced back to 10 years ago when I used to study various outstanding websites to guess the personality or attitude of the website owner. For me, a website is not just a platform for listing information, but also a window for communication and interaction. I draw inspiration from games, art installations, exhibitions, science fiction, or literary works to think about how to convey the spirit of clients to viewers in a more immersive way.
I also enjoy experimenting with cutting-edge or fun technologies with my friends as a way of storytelling within the limited pages/ screens.
For me, sparking inspiration and exploring innovation are essential parts of website design. I am willing to continuously experiment and try new things, incorporating more unique elements into designs, making each project full of personality and distinctive charm.

       This is a gate installation design for a game museum, which not only needs to be eye-catching, but also to integrate various game elements. Therefore, based on the client's preferences, I attempted to use LED lights and acrylic materials to suspend the elements and create a realistic game HUD (head-up display) visual effect.
